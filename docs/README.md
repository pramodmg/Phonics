## 📈 **Implementation Strategy**

The documentation follows a **7-day sprint approach** with features organized by:

1. **Priority Level** (Critical, High, Medium)
2. **Implementation Complexity** (Low, Medium, High effort)
3. **User Impact** (High impact features prioritized)
4. **Dependencies** (Features that build on each other)

## 🛠️ **Getting Started**

1. **Read the Enhancement Roadmap** - Understand what we're building
2. **Review Day 1 tasks** in the Implementation Tracker
3. **Set up your development environment** using the quick reference commands
4. **Start with Letter Tracing or Achievement System** (highest priority features)
5. **Track your progress** using the daily progress sheets

## 📝 **Contributing to Documentation**
